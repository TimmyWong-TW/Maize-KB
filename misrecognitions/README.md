## Correction Strategies

Things to consider:

### Full Text Replacement

- Text may actually be correct.
- Text consists of words that may span across segments.
- Automatic replacement should not be recursive.
  - Suggest replacments in a new version for review?
  - Use an LLM to reject obvious miscorrection?
