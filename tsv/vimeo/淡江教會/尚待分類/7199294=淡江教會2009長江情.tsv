I was only eight.Every week you would say a prayer.Before the class would start.One day when you said that prayer.I asked Jesus in my heart.Thank you for giving to the Lord. I am a life that was changed.Thank you for giving to the Lord.I am so glad you gave.Then another man stood before you.He said remember the time. A missionary came to your church.His pictures made you cry.He didn't have much money,but you gave it anyway.Jesus took the gift you gave,and that's why I'm here today. Thank you for giving to the LordI am so glad you gaveOne by one they cameFar as the eye could see Each life somehow touchedBy your generosityLittle things that you had doneSacrifices madeI noticed on the earthIn heaven now proclaimAnd I know up in heaven You're not supposed to cry.But I am almost sure.There were tears in your eyes.As Jesus took your hand.And you stood before the Lord.He said my child look around you.For great is your reward. Thank you for giving to the Lord.I am a life that was changed.Thank you for giving to the Lord.I am so glad 繁體中文， I am so glad you came.
